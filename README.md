this is a personal space to store learning notes and excercises I did when exploringLLM, ML and data analysis techniques.

Spent most of my time in undergraduate education on Economics, finally I realize doing trade and finance are really not my thing.     

Luckily I got the chance to take business analytics as a major for my master degree, so now I'm gradually putting my hands on those more hard-core subjects that I have interests.
